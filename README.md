# Mental_Konwledge_Graph_Dataset
This repository contains datasets and results from our research focusing on various aspects of drug and disease interactions. The data is organized into several key areas:

Symptom-Centric LCC Results: This section includes the results of our analysis on the Largest Connected Component (LCC) centered around specific symptoms. The data provides insights into how symptoms are interconnected within the network.

Co-Drug Results: Here, you will find the outcomes of our co-drug analysis, which explores the relationships and interactions between different drugs. This data is crucial for understanding how drugs can be used in combination for more effective treatments.

Drug Semantic Similarity: This dataset contains the semantic similarity scores between various drugs. These scores are derived from a comprehensive analysis of drug properties and their effects, providing a measure of how similar or different drugs are in terms of their therapeutic profiles.

Relative Risk (RR) Between Diseases: This section includes the calculated Relative Risk (RR) values between different diseases. The RR values help in understanding the risk factors and potential comorbidities associated with various diseases.

Network Distance Between Drugs: The final dataset provides the network distances between different drugs. This metric is derived from a network analysis and indicates how closely related drugs are within the drug interaction network.
